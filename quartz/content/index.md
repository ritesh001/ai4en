# Welcome

I am **Ritesh Kumar**, an Eric & Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Fellow at the **Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, University of Chicago**. My research focuses on accelerating materials discovery for next-generation energy storage and conversion devices using artificial intelligence and computational simulations.

## Research Interests

- **AI-driven materials discovery**: Developing machine learning techniques for materials discovery in batteries, (photo)electrocatalysts, and other energy technologies
- **Computational modeling**: Molecular dynamics and density functional theory for atomistic- and molecular-level investigation of materials and interfaces
- **Energy storage**: Molecular design of efficient electrolytes for next-generation batteries including lithium metal batteries
- **Energy conversion**: Rational design of efficient catalysts for key reactions of industrial importance
