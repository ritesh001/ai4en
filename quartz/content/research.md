## Research Philosophy

My approach integrates three pillars:

1. **First-Principles Understanding**: Using quantum mechanics and molecular simulations to understand fundamental mechanisms
2. **Data-Driven Discovery**: Leveraging machine learning and large databases to accelerate materials screening
3. **Experimental Validation**: Close collaboration with experimentalists to validate predictions and iterate designs

This synergistic approach has led to **22 publications** in high-impact journals and **3 manuscripts under review/preparation**.
